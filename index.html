    <div class="faq_question"><h2>What is CBD?</h2></div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div> <p class="faq_answer"> it’s short for cannabidiol. it’s one of more than a hundred cannabinoids found
      in the cannabis plant. unlike THC, another well-known cannabinoid, CBD is not psychoactive meaning it won’t make
      you feel altered or “high.”</p>

    <div class="faq_question"><h2>Is CBD Legal?</h2></div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div> <p class="faq_answer">yes. since the signing of the 2018 farm bill, the era of the hemp prohibition is
      over. hemp products, like CBD, have been permanently removed from the controlled substances act and are now
      deemed agricultural commodities. this means you can fly with it, drive with it and yes, fill your bathtub with
      breeze pens and swim in it (we know you were wondering).</p>

    <div class="faq_question"><h2>How Does CBD Work?</h2></div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div> <p class="faq_answer">the human body has an endocannabinoid system (ECS) that receives and translates
      signals from cannabinoids. you can think of your ECS like a communication network between your brain and central
      nervous system. this system is responsible for modulating your sleep, appetite, stress, anxiety, mood, immune
      system, reproduction, memory, pain and inflammation. once CBD enters the body, it attaches to receptors found
      along the ECS and quickly begins regulating the body’s balance.</p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <div> <p class="faq_answer">recommendations for individuals depend on their body weight, physical condition,
      and age. therefore, the right recommendation depends on your individual need and your body's response to CBD.
      generally suggested guidelines for a healthy individual are 10-30 mg CBD daily, however, we always recommend
      adjusting until you find your optimal dosage level.</p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <div> <p class="faq_answer">when compared to ingesting CBD oil, vaping can offer advantages for many users.
      when heated and inhaled, CBD and other cannabis-derived compounds are quickly absorbed into the body and can
      more effectively enter the ECS.</p>
